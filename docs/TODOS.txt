TODOs for v1 of this thing:


Left side needs a “Calendars” function
* Will effectively be a view-only function that lets user pick a schedule, look at calendar, pick a version, maybe toggles for overrides / etc
* Pick a decent calendaring component for this
* May bake in an export to ics or something, that’s supposed to be trivial

Future function for generic web hook functionality
* Ask Claude what this would take — we’d normally just drop a teams plugin and move, but that’s challenging
* It’s a builder (daily / weekly / monthly), sends content somewhere, blah blah blah

Need some better validation on the cron expression guy
* build out those samples too

Rewrite the README.md file
* talk about reflections on claude / gemini
