TODOs for v1 of this thing:



Let's go ahead and implement the overrides calendar UI functionality.  I propose we tackle this one step at a time.

Step 1:  Add a modal popup.  from the schedules list, we need a new Action called "Overrides" that will bring up a new modal dialog.  For now, it can simply be a list of the overrides already created with cancel and save buttons.  We'll be implementing a more sophisticated UI in a later step.

Step 2:  Adding a calendar component.  I have a calendar component (business-day-calendar.tsx) which can be found in the root of the holiday-guard-react module that handles a lot of the sophistication required by the UI.  Let's adapt this for use on the modal dialog previously created.  We'll have business days in green, non-business days in red, and overrides will be in green and red, but they'll have an outline.  The component already supports the bulk of this.  Please use this as a starting point and let's come up with a UI component that'll work with this project.

Step 3:  Wiring the data together.  The data that will be put in this component is a schedule, schedule rule, and a list of schedule overrides.  The backend will probably need to be able to take a schedule and schedule rule and spit out a list of days in a month so that the UI can be colored appropriately.  Then, the list of overrides can be placed over the top of that.

Step 4:  The UI needs to return an updated list of overrides so that they can be saved.  We don't need to really worry about merging the old list of overrides and the new list of overrides.  Each time they are saved we get a new "schedule version" that's effectively a combination of schedule, schedule rule, and list of overrides.

Step 5:  Implement the save logic described in Step 4.

Before starting, evaluate each step and provide feedback on anything you think is missed or should be added.

Let's go ahead and implement the overrides calendar UI functionality.  Here is the revised plan we agreed on before I had to go upgrade to the "pro" account.

* Step 1: Add a modal popup (Your plan is solid)
   * I will add a new "Overrides" button to the actions column in the Schedules.tsx component.
   * This will trigger a new modal, which I'll create in holiday-guard-react/src/components/OverridesModal.tsx.
   * For this initial step, the modal will fetch and display a simple, read-only list of existing overrides for the selected schedule to confirm the wiring.

* Step 2: Adding a calendar component (Good idea to use an existing component)
   * First, I need to locate business-day-calendar.tsx. You mentioned it's in the root of the holiday-guard-react module. I'll start by searching for that file.
   * I will then create a new wrapper component, ScheduleOverridesCalendar.tsx, that adapts the calendar for our specific use case, including the green/red/outlined coloring scheme you described.

* Step 3: Wiring the data together (Crucial backend dependency)
   * You've correctly identified that the UI needs a way to get the base calendar data. A new backend endpoint seems necessary. I propose we design the frontend around two new API endpoints:
       1. GET /api/v1/schedules/{scheduleId}/calendar?year={YYYY}&month={MM}: To get the calculated run/no-run days for a given month based on the schedule's primary rules.
       2. GET /api/v1/schedules/{scheduleId}/overrides: To get the list of all existing overrides for that schedule.
   * I will proceed with the frontend implementation assuming these endpoints will be available, and we can build the backend for them in parallel or subsequently.

* Step 4: The UI needs to return an updated list of overrides (Defining the interaction)
   * This is where the user interaction logic comes in. I'll implement the following behavior in the calendar:
       * Clicking a standard day (green or red) will create a new override for that day (a "force run" or "skip" respectively), which will be reflected in the UI with an outline.
       * Clicking a day that already has an override will remove that override, returning the day to its default state.
   * The OverridesModal will maintain the state of the user's changes, keeping track of the new set of overrides.

* Step 5: Implement the save logic (Creating a new version)
   * As you noted, saving overrides creates a new schedule version. I'll wire the "Save" button to send the new, complete list of overrides to the backend.
   * Based on the project documentation, this will be a POST request to the /api/v1/schedules/{id}/versions endpoint. I will need to investigate the exact payload structure this endpoint expects, but it
     will likely include the new set of overrides.

Let's work through this one step at a time, and allow me to review the work along the way!







Also need to add a “should run today” to the table maybe?  Just a “nice to have”

Left side needs an “audit table” that gathers all the “should run” calls.  Don’t need a materialized calendar just yet

Dashboard updates
* Don’t need total users
* Make total schedules / active schedules actually reflect data
* Recent activity should be a combination of the audit data + rollup of ui edits
* Server health maybe oughta update itself every 60 seconds?

Top header thing “Dashboard, Home / Dashboard” is not functional.  Ask about what it needs to be functional

Investigate what we’ll want for users
* Admin and invite thingy?
* Do we just do generic OAuth and walk on
* Answers to this will help decide what to do with icon in top-right.
* We expect app users and people users

Left side needs a “Calendars” function
* Will effectively be a view-only function that lets user pick a schedule, look at calendar, pick a version, maybe toggles for overrides / etc
* Pick a decent calendaring component for this
* May bake in an export to ics or something, that’s supposed to be trivial

Future function for generic web hook functionality
* Ask Claude what this would take — we’d normally just drop a teams plugin and move, but that’s challenging
* It’s a builder (daily / weekly / monthly), sends content somewhere, blah blah blah

Need some better validation on the cron expression guy
* build out those samples too

Rewrite the README.md file
* talk about reflections on claude / gemini
